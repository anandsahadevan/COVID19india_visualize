Data Visualization and Information Extraction from COVID19India API data usingÂ Python
https://www.covid19india.org/ is very successful in crowdsourcing the information from state bulletins (or official handles) to update the COVID19 trends in Indian states, districts and cities. The data is validated by a group of volunteers and published into a Google sheet, API (api.covid19india.org) and updates the website visualizations. In this article, we illustrate some of the valuable information derived from api.covid19india.org and COVID related socio-economic datasets.

This article doesn't contain any predictive model. The goal of this script is to do derive some categorical information and time-series trends at the state level and district level in India. "Without expert knowledge of epidemiology and public health, one should not publish any predictive model just from the time-series data.
